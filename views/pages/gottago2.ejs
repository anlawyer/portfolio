              A crowdsourced application that provides drivers with location and
              information about nearby bathrooms that other users have input. This
              app was created as a group project for the UC Berkeley Extension
              Coding Bootcamp.

              My role in the group was to create user stories for
              each page in the app, and design the wireframe and interactions for
              each story. I helped set up and maintain the MySQL database, and
              wrote routes for the flow of data from the frontend to the backend
              of application, including user data and location data.
              This is a full stack application using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL,
              Sequelize, Bulma, EJS, HTML, JavaScript and jQuery.

              This application is a React-based mobile web application, a refactor
              of the previous group project by the same name. Its purpose
              is to crowdsource local restrooms for frequent drivers and busy people
              on the go. Users can see local restrooms, signed in members can add comments
              and new restrooms they find. This application was built using React
              and MongoDB/mLab, as well as Node.js and Express. The front end was
              constructed using Redux, Bulma, HTML/JSX/CSS, and Bloomer, a library of
              stateless React components. It utilizes API calls to the MongoDB/mLab
              database to post and retrieve restrooms and comments. Redux is used for
              loading the Google Map according to the user's location. By making calls
              to the Google Maps API, users can also get directions to their restroom
              of choice. The application is still in development.

              I created this wireframe, layout, component structure, and data flow
              with backend routes. All together, it is defined as an "interaction flow."
              This was helpful for my team as a sort of "health check"
              as we progressed through the project. We were able to check back on this
              structure whenever we were a little stuck to remember how things should
              be arranged.
