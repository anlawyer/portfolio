              This application is a React-based mobile web application, a refactor
              of the previous group project by the same name. Its purpose
              is to crowdsource local restrooms for frequent drivers and busy people
              on the go. Users can see local restrooms, signed in members can add comments
              and new restrooms they find. This application was built using React
              and MongoDB/mLab, as well as Node.js and Express. The front end was
              constructed using Redux, Bulma, HTML/JSX/CSS, and Bloomer, a library of
              stateless React components. It utilizes API calls to the MongoDB/mLab
              database to post and retrieve restrooms and comments. Redux is used for
              loading the Google Map according to the user's location. By making calls
              to the Google Maps API, users can also get directions to their restroom
              of choice. The application is still in development.

              I created this wireframe, layout, component structure, and data flow
              with backend routes. All together, it is defined as an "interaction flow."
              This was helpful for my team as a sort of "health check"
              as we progressed through the project. We were able to check back on this
              structure whenever we were a little stuck to remember how things should
              be arranged.
